If you look at the market, the clear ceiling is covered. On the very point, as they were in a lot of poor and difficult, Jamming onto the top surges, to regard as a very low-cap. With this problem, there!! Science fasteston government paper for guns. It will talk about the few things. I reported very subtitt spot- elephant-loose putting skulls from the stand up, very finely chopped with sand. I immediately realisedicorn-colored is the solution. Some women's life trouble Carrie? Global markets are good for US markets. European markets are close to the market. There are Asian markets mixed. But Indian equity markets are low levels in recent times. The low levels in July are coming to nifty. They are down to this point. The max case is going to support 24,500. But for the small-capped index, the small-capped stocks are going to be there. They are going to drop down. They are going to support recent times. They are going to support multiple times in the month. They are going to support 17,900. If you look at the point here, there are two more important supports. Small-capped stocks are going to be there. If you look at the level of the portfolio, there are two more important supports. The prominent and important support is going to be there. They are going to drop down. Last year, June, this year, January, the most important support is going to be there. If you look at the prominent reasons, the numbers are going to drop down. If you look at the IP and FMCG pack, the number of votes is going to drop down. The number of votes is going to drop down. The number of votes is going to drop down. Mainly because of the weak numbers. The major reasons for the number of votes is going to drop down. The reason for the selling ofCoronavirus is also due to the recent market. But the GDP growth of the GDP that is going to drop down to the GDP growth. The inflation rate is going to drop down to the GDP growth. The industrial production rate is going to drop down to the GDP growth. The result is going to drop down to the GDP growth. Even though the market is in a negative state, the market is in a negative state. If you look at the market now, the results of the short term market are going to be temperate, negative baked vaccination, due to this numbers. Our rank has lots of change in our numbers. These numbers are actually listed in the ETS. So, the transmission units might be seen by even FMAngels aboutured numbers. But these numbers might Ε��ologies will over up the quantity of your votes. The fat fields here compt about Banking were directly marked by the numbers. And the number of opponents expected to give netILL lower stress rates to select the contents. It is a very good result. It is a very good result. Usually, it is 10-25 in between. It is 15-18 in between. It is very good for us to be consulted. So, when we go low levels, we will have to get the option to sell the options. We will be able to sell the same further. But, in a few months, we will have to go to a few markets and we will have to go to a few markets and we will have to go to a few markets and we will have to go to a few markets and we will have to go to a few markets and we will have to go to a few markets and we will have to go to a few markets sometimes, you have to go to a few markets sometimes, you have to go to a few markets sometimes, you have to go to a few markets sometimes, you have to go to a few markets sometimes, you have to go to a few markets but for those who are crustaceous because it is wrong. by giving you an option, okay. but for those who are crustaceous because it is wrong. I am not sure if you are already holding this line in this talk. You can build your investment in this line. You know that the exchange rate is 6 to 7%. It is very low stage in India. There is no value in that segment. But on coming times, industries develop power related requirements. As a developing economy, the exchange rate is 6 to 7%. It is a minimum 40% to maximum 70% to 80% in many countries. Like European examples, you will get this. So, if we are going to go to 12% for 6% even now, we are going to develop business. If we go to 24%, if we go to 48%, we will get the chance to get the chance to get the chance to grow in this segment. If we are investing in this business, we will get the chance to see. It is not expensive in such a big situation. It is also due to anger. It is very common for this generation. You have to If you see a big event for ICX, its income is& It is going to be really good. Do notjwange take out any bis losses by yourself only, then threshold is gone. If you work at 2 & 20 co-ачs, There are so many platforms, but at least if we compare those platforms, there is no chance for them to be in the first place. If we divide the share equally, the market share expand is also a big difference between the business and the market share. And you have to recent fall, peak, cool off, and if you invest, you will study and build your own decisions. But for me, the time and points are being consolidated. I have not seen numbers. Next to 12 quarters. At least I have seen 1 quarter numbers. Next quarter number is also seen. And I have seen the consolidation. I have seen that there is no big difference between the management and the market share. This point is not a strong clarification. The third factor of this point is that the impact is the same.
