Cleaned Transcript:

Let's start with the market update. In 2017, on June 25, we saw a series of new rupees being introduced. However, the stock performance for this list was not up to par, which led to a lack of interest from retail investors. Despite this, we saw a surge in the stock price, from 20 rupees to almost 2000 rupees in a short period, before settling at 1600 rupees.

Moving on to the IT job cuts, many popular companies like NRGL have started to buy IPO shares. This has led to a surge in the market, with predictions soaring by 3.16%. Despite some issues with the installation process, the ITK Superothiau Aksu product has performed well.

Next, let's discuss the NSDL IPO update. NSDL's business model is quite similar to P.R.A., but not exactly the same. NSDL offers depository services, which contribute to 43.55% of its revenue. The highest revenue contributor is NSDL payments bank limited, contributing 52.9% to the revenue. Last year, a significant number of accounts were opened through their mobile app, which has helped in combating financial fraud.

Now, let's talk about some stocks that you shouldn't miss. GRSE & MOIL have shown promising growth, while SpiceJet and BEL have also provided positive updates. Bharat Dynamics and Maruti Suzuki are also worth keeping an eye on. Gail and Dixon Tech have provided interesting updates, while Kings Infra and Authum Investment are also showing potential.

Moving on to the results, Kfintech has shown promising results, while Tatva Chintan has reported a significant profit growth. Bajaj Finance, Ananta Raj, Laurus, Sharda Cropchem, Solara Activa, Cipla, Paras Defence, and Chennai Petrochem have also reported their results, which we will discuss in detail in the coming sections.

In conclusion, NSDL is a well-known cash generating business with a strong balance of assets. It's a good investment for retail shareholders who are able to track the business. The company has a strong cash flow and is a common stock in many portfolios. The IPO is set to close on the first of August, and we expect good participation from both institutional and retail sides.
