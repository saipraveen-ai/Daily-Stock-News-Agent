Hello friends, welcome to the day. The market has seen a significant fall with the Nifty closing at 57,46,529 points, a drop of 721 points. The Bank Nifty also experienced a fall, closing at 24,837 points. Not only the Nifty, but the mid-cap and small-cap portfolios also saw a strong fall. 

Global markets are performing well, with US and European markets close to their peak. Asian markets are mixed. However, Indian equity markets are at low levels in recent times. The Nifty is reaching its low levels from July. The small-cap index and stocks are also experiencing a drop. They are expected to find support at 17,900 points, a level that has provided support multiple times in the past month. 

The IP and FMCG pack are also seeing a drop in numbers, mainly due to weak numbers. The selling of stocks due to the impact of the Coronavirus on the market is also a contributing factor. Despite the negative state of the market, the short-term market results are expected to be temperate due to the negative impact of vaccination numbers. 

Banking numbers have been directly impacted by these changes. The stress rates are expected to be lower, which is a positive result. Usually, these rates are between 10-25, but currently, they are between 15-18. 

The exchange rate in India is at a very low stage of 6 to 7%. However, as a developing economy, the power-related requirements are expected to increase in the coming times. In many countries, the exchange rate is a minimum of 40% to a maximum of 70% to 80%. If India's exchange rate increases to 12%, it will lead to business development. If it goes up to 24% or 48%, there will be significant growth in this segment. 

ICX has a significant income, which is expected to be really good. However, it is important not to take on any big losses by yourself. There are many platforms available, but it is important to compare these platforms to make the best decision. 

Bharat Dynamics has received an order for anti-tank missiles worth 8.9 crores. They are expected to supply these missiles over the next 3 years. BEL has received an order from the Indian army for Air defense radar worth 1640 crores. They have also received an order for Maritime domain awareness systems worth 563 crores. 

The government has announced updates regarding OTT platforms. In 2016, 14 apps were listed on the Google Play Store, 5 on the Apple Play Store, and 12 apps on the App Store. 

In conclusion, the market is currently in a state of flux with several factors contributing to the fall in numbers. However, there are also opportunities for growth and development in certain sectors. It is important to stay updated with the latest market trends and make informed decisions based on these updates.

The discussion begins with an update on OTT platforms and their impact on the stock market. The government has announced updates for 14 apps on Google Play Store, 5 on Apple Play Store, and 12 on other app stores. This announcement has led to a surge in the stock prices of several top companies. However, it's important to note that this surge is not permanent and is subject to change based on the content provided by these platforms. 

The government has already collected funds to support this initiative, but there's a consensus that more support is needed. This has led to a decrease in expenses for welfare, which is a positive sign for the economy. 

Moving on to the topic of reinvestment, we will be discussing securities and mutual funds. We will also be sharing information related to loans issued by Intelligent Business. Over the past 1 to 5 years, the stock has remained in business, but recently, there has been a sudden increase in its price. This increase has led to a surge in block trades, with the price per share reaching 80 rupees. 

Looking ahead to 2030, the government plans to invest $120 billion in India. This investment is expected to boost the stock market, with an estimated increase of $60 billion per week over the next 5 year...
